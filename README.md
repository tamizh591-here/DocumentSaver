# DocumentSaver
Hello , There !
             I hope this message finds you in good health!!

We know that in order to take a screenshot or proof of the results, we need to open the snipping tool, drag the area that needs to be taken, open the document in.docx format, and then paste it here. Keep going! This is the standard method for doing it correctly.

If you use this script , we don't need to use the snipping tool or some other keys to take screenshot!

Let's get into it.
Pre-requirement :
1. Install Python (Any version).
2. Install pip.
3. Install pyautogui.
4. Install docx.
5. Install keyboard (lib)

 Then run this script.

Note: You can customize your own keyboard keys !!

Happy Learning !
